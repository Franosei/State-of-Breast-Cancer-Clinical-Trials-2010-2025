CRFs in a neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting could be somewhat simpler. Endpoint Setting TAUG Reference Pathologic Complete Response (pCR) Neoadjuvant Not included * Event -Free Survival (EFS) Neoadjuvant Analysis Section 5.1.1.3 Disease -Free Survival (DFS) Adjuvant Analysis Section 5.1.1.4 Overall Survival (OS) Neoadjuvant , Adjuvant , Advanced Analysis Section 5.1.1.2 Best Overall Response Advanced Analysis Section 5.1.2.1 Duration of Response Advanced Analysis Section 5.1.1.5 Progress ion-Free Survival (PFS) Advanced Analysis Section 5.1.1.1 * Pathologic Complete Response (pCR) is not described in the analysis section because the final analysis of a binary endpoint is simple, and the derivation of the endpoint depends on the definition used, which will vary by study.
