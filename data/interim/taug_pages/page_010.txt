Many of the risk factors for breast cancer can be traced back to the cumulative exposure of the breast to estrogen and progesterone, which influence the rate of cell di vision. Cell proliferation of breast epithelial cells and a series of genetic changes such as activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppression genes ultimately lead to development of a malignant phenotype. A small proportion of cases of breast cancer (5- 10%) are directly related to inherited (germline) mutati ons in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes.5 3.1 Diagnosis The d iagnos tic workup of breast cancer at entry into clinical trials is important because the type of breast cancer and associated risk factors influence survival and may affect eligibility. In addition, randomization and analysis may be stratified by risk factors. The type of data collected is influenced by the sta ge of breast cancer being evaluated in the clinical trial. Generally, studies in advanced breast cancer will collect data both on the initial breast cancer diagnosis and from additional diagnostic workups conducted when the subject enters the study. Data on breast cancer initial diagnosis includes the age at initial diagnosis and the date of diagnosis. Observations that may contribute to the breast cancer initial diagnosis include : • Self-assessment (palpation, sympto ms of pain, redness, swelling) • Clinical examination s • Imaging (mammography, MRI, C T, CT/PET, ultrasound, bone scan; see Section 4.2 ) • Fine needle aspiration (FNA), core needle, and/or excisional b iopsy (histopathology (cell type and grade) , genetic sequencing, gene expression assessment, grading ) • Pathologic assessment (see Section 3.3) For the purposes of this TAUG, the definition of diagnosis can refer to the following categories : • Confirma tion that breast cancer is present • Confirmation on the type of brea st cancer that is present • Determination on the severity/ extent of the breast cancer
