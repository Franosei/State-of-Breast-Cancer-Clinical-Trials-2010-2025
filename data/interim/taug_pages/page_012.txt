CDISC Therapeutic Area Data Standards: User Guide for Breast Cancer (Version 1.0 Provisional) Page 12 © 2016 Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium, Inc. All rights reserved May 16, 2016 Provisional 3.2 Staging Disease staging describes the extent to which the malignancy has sp read in the body. It contributes to the determination of treatment options and to the estimation of a patient’s prognosis. The staging system for breast cancer is described in the American Joint Co mmittee on Cancer (AJCC) Cancer Staging Manual,6 which uses the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) TNM Classification.7 T, N, and M stand for primary tumor , regional lymph node , and distant metastasis .6 The stage of breast cancer can be based on indirect measurements from physical exam and imaging tests (clinical staging ), and/or on observations made directly on surgically sampled ti ssue (pathologic staging ). Pathologic staging may provide more accurate information than clinical staging , since it requires the breast tumor mass and nearby lymph nodes to be examined macroscopically and microscopically by a pathologist. Concept Map 2: Breast Cancer Staging Concept map is based on the NCI Stage Information for Breast Cancer8 and the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual.6 Ipsilateral nodes are nodes on the same side of the body as the tumor. The UICC TNM Classification used in breast cancer staging is a named and copyrighted instrument. Guidance on mapping its components to SDTM will be provided as part of a s upplement developed by the Questionnaires, Ratings, and Scales (QRS) team , provided that permission to do so is granted by the copyright holder .
