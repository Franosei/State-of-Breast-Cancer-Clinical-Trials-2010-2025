CDISC Therapeutic Area Data Standards: User Guide for Breast Cancer (Version 1.0 Provisional) Page 20 Â© 2016 Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium, Inc. All rights reserved May 16, 2016 Provisional Common Name (Abbreviation) Description Tubular Breast Cancer An invasive breast carcinoma comprised of tubular structures lined by a single layer of epithelium. Tubular breast cancer has a favorable prognosis. Terms and descriptions in this table were informed by contributions from CFAST membership organizations and by the NCI EVS . 3.3.1 Examples for Pathology Example 1 In this example , IHC for Estrogen Receptor protein expression in a tissue was reported as an overall status , along with details used to determine that overall status. Those details are percentage of cells staining positive, proportion score (PS), stain intensity positivity score (IS), and a total score (TS). This example has been m odeled in a fashion consistent with the examples given for the Microscopic Findings (MI) domain in SDTMIG v3.2. For scores that were determined using a multi -point scale, the number of points in the scale was placed in a n NSV, PTSCL. Controlled terminology for MITSTDTL is in development. Row 1: Shows the overal l status for estrogen receptor positivity , which was determined from the TS (see R ow 5) , where TS of >=3 is considered Posit ive. Row 2: Shows the percentage of cells that stained positive. Row 3: Shows PS, which was assigned based on the percentage of positive cells, using a six -point scale. Row 4: Shows IS, which was scored from 0 to 3 , based on the intensity of the scale. Row 5: Shows the total score, which is t he sum of PS and IS. mi.xpt Row STUDYID DOMAIN USUBJID MISEQ MITESTCD MITEST MITSTDTL MIORRES MIORRESU MISTRESC MISTRESN MISTRESU 1 ACB MI ACB-1201 1 ER Estrogen Receptor Overall Status POSITIVE POSITIVE 2 ACB MI ACB-1201 2 ER Estrogen Receptor Percent Positive Cell 8 % 8 8 % 3 ACB MI ACB-1201 3 ER Estrogen Receptor Proportion Score 2 2 2 4 ACB MI ACB-1201 4 ER Estrogen Receptor Intensity Positivity Score +2 2 2 5 ACB MI ACB-1201 5 ER Estrogen Receptor Total Score 4 4 4 Row MISPEC MILOC MIMETHOD MIDRVFL VISIT VISITNUM PTSCL 1 (cont) TISSUE BREAST IHC Y SCREENING 10 2 (cont) TISSUE BREAST IHC SCREENING 10 3 (cont) TISSUE BREAST IHC Y SCREENING 10 6-Point Scale 4 (cont) TISSUE BREAST IHC SCREENING 10 4-Point Scale 5 (cont) TISSUE BREAST IHC Y SCREENING 10 Relevant metadata for PTSCL, from the define.xml file that would accompany submission, are tabula ted below.
