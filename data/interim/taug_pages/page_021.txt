All rights reserved Page 21 Provisional May 16, 2016 See also SDTMIG v3.2, Section 6.3 - MI Domain: Examples 1 and 2. Example 2 In this example, the subject underwent a lumpectomy at W eek 4 that produced a measurable tumor that was assessed by an independent pathologist (see Section 4.1.1 , Exam ple 1). This example was modeled in a fashion consistent with Tumor Identification in the TU doma in and Tumor Results in the TR d omain in SDTMIG v3.2 . Note that TULNK ID/TR LNK ID is populated to allow linking between TU and TR records and TUREFID/PRREFID /MIREFID is populated to allow linking between TU and the record of the surgery in PR and the record of surgical margin status in MI via RELREC.
