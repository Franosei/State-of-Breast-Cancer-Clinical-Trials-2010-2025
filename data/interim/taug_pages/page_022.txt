All rights reserved May 16, 2016 Provisional 3.4 Prior Treatments If the subject s are not newly diagnosed with breast cancer when they join the study, any prior antineoplastic therapies ( i.e., anti-cancer treatments ) may be of special interest to the study. Even if subjects are newly diagnosed, it may still be relevant to collect prior treatments for any other cancers they may have had. 3.4.1 Examples for Prior Treatments Example 1 This is an example of a study where prior antineoplastic medications were collected. The example dataset below shows sample data for two subjects where prior antineoplastic medication s were administered. The sponsor has chosen to capture medications by regimen because they expect to perform regimen -based analysis, which can be impacted by the combinations of medications given, and by the setting in which they were give n. Row s 1-2: Subject ABC 123-1234 was taking two medications as part of the same regimen (CMGRPID) in a neoadjuvant setting . Row 3: Subject ABC 123-1234 was taking one medication as the second regimen (CMGRPID) in an adjuvant setting. Row 4: Subject ABC 123-2345 was taking one medication as the first regimen (CMGRPID) in an adjuvant setting . Row s 5-6: Subject ABC 123-2345 was taking two medications as part of the second regimen (CMGRPID) in therapeutic -metastatic setting. cm.xpt Row STUDYID DOMAIN USUBJID CMSEQ CMGRPID CMTRT CMDOSE CMDOSU CMCAT CMINDC CMSTDTC 1 ABC123 CM ABC123 -1234 1 REGIMEN 1 DOXORUBICIN 60 mg/m2 ANTI -CANCER THERAPY BREAST CANCER 2005 -08-15 2 ABC123 CM ABC123 -1234 2 REGIMEN 1 CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE 600 mg/kg ANTI -CANCER THERAPY BREAST CANCER 2005 -08-15 3 ABC123 CM ABC123 -1234 3 REGIMEN 2 TAMOXIFEN 20 mg ANTI -CANCER THERAPY BREAST CANCER 2006 -06-15 4 ABC123 CM ABC123 -2345 1 REGIMEN 1 PACLITAXEL 175 mg/m2 ANTI -CANCER THERAPY BREAST CANCER 2005 -04-04 5 ABC123 CM ABC123 -2345 2 REGIMEN 2 VINFLUNINE 320 mg/m2 ANTI -CANCER THERAPY BREAST CANCER 2010 -03-15 6 ABC123 CM ABC123 -2345 3 REGIMEN 2 GEMCITABINE 1000 mg/m2 ANTI -CANCER THERAPY BREAST CANCER 2010 -03-15 Variable -level metadata for the NSVs, from the define.xml file that would accompany submission, are given in tabulated form below.
