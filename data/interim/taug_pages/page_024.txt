The approach for representing PRLOCOTH is available in the S DTM IG and will not be repeated in th is TAUG. Row 1: Subject ABC 123-1234 had a prior radiotherapy treatment given to the supraclavicular lymph nodes in an adjuvant setting . Row s 2-3: Subject ABC 123-2345 had two prior radiotherapy treatment s: one given to the breast in a neoadjuvant setting, and the other given to the lumba r vertebrae in a metastatic setting. Row 4: Subject ABC 123-2346 had a prior radiotherapy treatment given to the axillary lymph nodes in an adjuvant setting.
