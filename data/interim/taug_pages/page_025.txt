The following list contains examples of some of the possible comorbidities that may be collected for breast cancer clinical trials. • Diabetes • Obesity • Anemia • Hypertension • Cardiovascular diseases • Cerebrovascular diseases • Chronic O bstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) • Renal disease • Liver injury • Hepatitis B • Hepatitis C • Osteoporosis Family History Family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer is associated with increased breast cancer risk, and is particularly relevant to chemoprevention trials and risk reduction studies. It is also useful for determining whether additional , more extensive genetic risk assessment (e. g., BRCA1 or BRCA 2 mutation testing) and counseling should be undertaken. Information of interest about bio logical relatives may include: • Their degree of relation ship to the subject • Whether they had breast or ovarian cancer, and if so, o Age at diagnosis o If it was b ilateral breast cancer
