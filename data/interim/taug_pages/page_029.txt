Row 1: Represents administration of external beam radiation to the right breast , given each weekday over a period of 25 days . The intended schedule is represented in PRDOSRGM , as this can not be expressed as a frequency . Row 2: Represents brachytherapy administered to the left breast on a single occasion. Row 3: Represents radiation to bone , given once a day for three days. pr.xpt Row STUDYID DOMAIN USUBJID PRSEQ PRTRT PRDOSE PRDOSU PRDOSFRQ PRDOSRGM PRLOC PRLAT PRSTDTC PRENDTC 1 ABC123 PR ABC123 - 1001 1 External beam radiation therapy 70 Gy EACH WEEKDAY BREAST RIGHT 2011- 06-01 2011- 06-25 2 ABC123 PR ABC123 - 2002 1 Brachytherapy 25 Gy ONCE BREAST LEFT 2011- 07-15 2011- 07-15 3 ABC123 PR ABC123 - 3003 1 Radiotherapy 300 cGy QD BONE 2011- 08-19 2011- 08-21 4.1.2 Treatment Side Effects For many cancer treatments, one of the aims of early development is the characterization of side effects, including the ident ification of dose-limiting toxicities. This aspect of breast cancer study data is beyond the scope of this version of the TAUG -BrCa . In later development, adverse events that have been found to be associated with a drug will be a focus of data collection and analysis. Data collection will depend on the particular side effects, and varies considerably among breast cancer treatments, so is not covered here. Advice for analysis of adverse events within ADaM structure can be found at: http://www.cdisc.org/adam . In studies of advanced breast cancer, subjects may h ave received many prior treatments. Those treatments may include those with known cardiotoxicities, such as anthracyclines. Cardiotoxicity is associated with cumulative lifetime exposure to these drugs, so it may be important to capture prior and ongoing e xposure to
