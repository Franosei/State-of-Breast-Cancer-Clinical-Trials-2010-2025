CDISC Therapeutic Area Data Standards: User Guide for Breast Cancer (Version 1.0) © 2016 Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium, Inc. All rights reserved Page 37 Provisional May 16, 2016 Example 1 This is an example of how data regarding tumor identification via imaging performed at screening might be represented . In a F indings domain record , --METHOD and --DTC are often enough to identify an imaging procedure. If additional procedure information needs to be captured, then the sponsor may cho ose to create a separate, related PR record. In this example, the sponsor has chosen to represent the imaging procedure information using the Procedure (PR) domain. Row 1: For S ubject ABC 123-1234 , a required Chest X -Ray was acquired on 15APR2014. The Chest X -Ray was pre -specified on the CRF with Yes/No check boxes . Rows 2 -4: For S ubject ABC 123-2345 , a CT scan was acquired on 30MAY2014. The scan covered the chest, abdomen , and pelvis. The imaging was not pre - specified on the CRF. pr.xpt Row STUDYID DOMAIN USUBJID PRSEQ PRREFID PRSPID PRTRT PRPRESP PROCCUR PRLOC VISITNUM VISIT PRSTDTC 1 ABC123 PR ABC123 -1234 1 0124578 1 X-RAY Y Y CHEST 10 SCREENING 2014 -04-15 2 ABC123 PR ABC123 -2345 1 6587466_1 CT SCAN CHEST 10 SCREENING 2014 -05-30 3 ABC123 PR ABC123 -2345 2 6587466_2 CT SCAN ABDOMINAL CAVITY 10 SCREENING 2014 -05-30 4 ABC123 PR ABC123 -2345 3 6587466_3 CT SCAN PELVIS 10 SCREENING 2014 -05-30 Any tumors or lesions identified by examining the images produced are included in the Tumor Identification (TU) domain. Note that TU only holds the identification data for each tumor or lesion; tumor results are held in the Tumor Results (TR) domain. Row 1: Shows the tumor identified for Subject ABC 123-1234. Row s 2 and 4: Show a target tumor and a non -target tumor identified for Subject ABC123 -2345 . Row 3: Subject ABC 123-2345 ’s screening visit also i dentified a pleural effusion. The effusion may or may not be malignant, but RECIST criteria are geared toward assessing solid tumors, and an effusion is excess fluid. Therefore, it was marked as non -target. tu.xpt Row STUDYID DOMAIN USUBJID TUSEQ TUREFID TULNKID TUTESTCD TUTEST TUORRES TUSTRESC TULOC TULAT 1 ABC123 TU ABC123 -1234 1 0124578 T01 TUMIDENT Tumor Identification TARGET TARGET BREAST RIGHT 2 ABC123 TU ABC123 -2345 1 6587466_1 T01 TUMIDENT Tumor Identification TARGET TARGET BREAST LEFT 3 ABC123 TU ABC123 -2345 2 6587466_1 NT01 TUMIDENT Tumor Identification NON -TARGET NON -TARGET PLEURAL CAVITY 4 ABC123 TU ABC123 -2345 3 6587466_1 NT02 TUMIDENT Tumor Identification NON -TARGET NON -TARGET BREAST RIGHT Row TUMETHOD TUEVAL TUEVALID VISITNUM VISIT TUDTC PRTYP 1 (cont) X-RAY INDEPENDENT ASSESSOR RADIOLOGIST 10 SCREENING 2014 -04-15 2 (cont) CT SCAN INDEPENDENT ASSESSOR RADIOLOGIST 10 SCREENING 2014 -05-30 3 (cont) CT SCAN INDEPENDENT ASSESSOR RADIOLOGIST 10 SCREENING 2014 -05-30 EFFUSION 4 (cont) CT SCAN INDEPENDENT ASSESSOR RADIOLOGIST 10 SCREENING 2014 -05-30 Relevant metadata for PRTYP , from the define.xml file that would accompany submission, are given in tabulat ed form below.
