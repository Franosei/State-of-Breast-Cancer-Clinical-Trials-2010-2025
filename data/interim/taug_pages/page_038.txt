TU NSV Metadata Variable Label Type Role Origin PRTYP Tumor or Lesion Presentation Type text Non-Standard Record Qualifier CRF Since there are records in PR for the procedure that produced the images used to obtain the findings in TU, RE LREC is used to relate these records to each other. In this example, the sponsor has decided to use --REFID consistently across domains, so the relationship can be made at the dataset level. relrec.xpt Row STUDYID DOMAIN USUBJID IDVAR IDVARVAL RELTYPE RELID 1 ABC123 PR PRREFID ONE A 2 ABC123 TU TUREFID MANY A Example 2 This example is for a trial in a metastatic setting where the subjects have sites of disease at baseline. The sample data and modeling are from SDTM Examples for Oncology Use Cases (available at: http://wiki.cdisc.org/x/5yuyAQ ), Example 14. In this example, the subject has one target lesion and two non -target lesions. The target lesion is in the liver. One of the non -target lesions is in the bone, and the other is in the pleural cavity. The lesion in the pleural cavity is an effusion, which i s also its most distinguishing characteristic. Therefore, the non-standard variable PRTYP (Tumor Presentation Type ), which is intended for use in distinguishing non-measurable lesions in more detail than the combination of the standard location variables c an provide, has been populated with “EFFUSION.” tu.xpt Row STUDYID DOMAIN USUBJID TUSEQ TUREFID TULNKID TUTESTCD TUTEST TUORRES TUSTRESC TULOC 1 VWX7777 TU VWX7777 -90000 1 IMG -00001 T01 TUMIDENT Tumor Identification TARGET TARGET LIVER 2 VWX7777 TU VWX7777 -90000 2 IMG -00002 NT01 TUMIDENT Tumor Identification NON -TARGET NON -TARGET BONE 3 VWX7777 TU VWX7777 -90000 3 IMG -00001 NT02 TUMIDENT Tumor Identification NON -TARGET NON -TARGET PLEURAL CAVITY Row TUMETHOD TUEVAL EPOCH VISITNUM VISIT TUDTC TUDY PRTYP 1 (cont) CT SCAN INVESTIGATOR SCREEN 10 SCREEN 2010 -01-02 -2 2 (cont) SCINTIGRAPHY INVESTIGATOR SCREEN 10 SCREEN 2010 -01-01 -3 3 (cont) CT SCAN INVESTIGATOR SCREEN 10 SCREEN 2010 -01-02 -2 EFFUSION TU NSV Metadata Variable Label Type Role Origin PRTYP Tumor or Lesion Presentation Type text Non-Standard Record Qualifier CRF The tumors were identified by CT SCAN of the CHEST/ABDOMEN/PELVIS and SCINTIGRAPHY of the BONE , which is recorded in PR.
