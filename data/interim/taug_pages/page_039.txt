Row 3: Shows the CT scan of the subject ’s torso (described in PRLOC as MULTIPL E and PRLOC1/PRLOC2/PRLOC3 as ABDOMEN/ CHEST /PELVIS) performed at Week 12. Row 4: Shows that the bone scintigraphy was not performed at Week 12.

The RS domain holds records for the target and non -target tumors/sites of disease response to treatment, as defined using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. Rows 1 -3: The tumors show partial response (PR) to treatment in Week 12. Note that the non- target response ( Row 2) is given as “Not All Evaluated ” due to the lack of a bone scintigraphy image (pr.xpt, Row 4). TR would hold a record that states the scan was not performed for at least one non -target lesion . The sample data and modeling are from SDTM Exam ples for Oncology Use Cases (available at: http://wiki.cdisc.org/x/5yuyAQ ), Example 14. Rows 4 -6: The tumors show complete response (CR) to treatment in Week 24, indicating that all signs of cancer have disappeared.
