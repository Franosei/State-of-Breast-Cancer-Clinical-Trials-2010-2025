Suspicion of recurrence may result from self -assessment, routine mammogram , or physician assessment. If there is a suspicion of breast cancer recurrence, imaging and/or biopsy will take place to confirm or rule out recurrence. Recurrent breast cancer is often classified by the location of the recurrence relative to the original site: • Local Recurrence: Cancerous tumor cells remain in the original site and , over time, grow back. Many physicians do not consider local breast cancer recurrence to be the spread of breast cancer, but rather, failure of the primary treatment. Even after mastectomy, portions o f the breast skin and fat remain, and local recurrence is possible.
