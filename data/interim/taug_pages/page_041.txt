R egional breast cancer recurrences can occur in the pectoral muscles, in the internal mammary lymph nodes under the breastbone and between the ribs, in the supraclavicular nodes, and in the nodes surrounding the neck. • Distant Recurrence: A distant breast cancer recurrence, also known as a metastasis, is the most dangerous type of recurrence.
