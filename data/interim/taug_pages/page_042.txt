Examples of response assessment to palliative therapy are provided in Section 4.2.1 . This example shows two radiological assessments : Disease recurrence was not identified at the first assessment , but was identified at the second assessment. The sample data and modeling are from SDTM Examples for Oncology Use Cases (available at: http://wiki.cdisc.org/x/5yuyAQ ), Example 12. In this e xample , the subject was monitored for signs of recurrence, with CT scanning of the chest and abdomen/pelvis and an MRI of the head performed at each disease assessment time point. These scans were performed per protocol to look for recurrence. Unfortunately for this subject, disease recurrence was identified in various locations at Week 36. A local disease recurrence was identi fied in the left breast ; regional disease recurrence was identified in the internal mammary and infraclavicular lymph nodes on the same side; and distant disease recurrence was identified in the liver and colon. The PR domain holds the records of the scanning procedures performed. The image identifier for each resulting scan is in PRREFID. Rows 1 -3: Show the CT scanning and MRI performed at screening. There are no TU records associated with these scans, which is in keeping with an adjuvant setting. Rows 4-6: Show the CT scanning and MRI performed at Week 20. There are no TU records associated with these scans either. Rows 7-8: Show the CT scanning performed at Week 36. Note that the values in PRREFID ( IMG -00007 and IMG -00008) match those in TUREFID for Rows 1-6 of the tu.xpt example below. Row 9: Shows the MRI performed of the head at Week 36, which did not identify any disease recurrence. pr.xpt Row STUDYID DOMAIN USUBJID PRSEQ PRREFID PRLNKGRP PRTRT PRPRESP PROCCUR PRLOC EPOCH VISITNUM VISIT 1 PQR4444 PR PQR4444 -70000 1 IMG -00001 A1 CT SCAN Y Y CHEST SCREEN 10 SCREEN 2 PQR4444 PR PQR4444 -70000 2 IMG -00002 A1 CT SCAN Y Y ABDOMEN/PELVIS SCREEN 10 SCREEN 3 PQR4444 PR PQR4444 -70000 3 IMG -00003 A1 MRI Y Y HEAD SCREEN 10 SCREEN 4 PQR4444 PR PQR4444 -70000 5 IMG -00004 A2 CT SCAN Y Y CHEST TREATMENT 80 WEEK 20 5 PQR4444 PR PQR4444 -70000 6 IMG -00005 A2 CT SCAN Y Y ABDOMEN/PELVIS TREATMENT 80 WEEK 20 6 PQR4444 PR PQR4444 -70000 7 IMG -00006 A2 MRI Y Y HEAD TREATMENT 80 WEEK 20 7 PQR4444 PR PQR4444 -70000 8 IMG -00007 A3 CT SCAN Y Y CHEST TREATMENT 120 WEEK 36 8 PQR4444 PR PQR4444 -70000 9 IMG -00008 A3 CT SCAN Y Y ABDOMEN/PELVIS TREATMENT 120 WEEK 36 9 PQR4444 PR PQR4444 -70000 10 IMG -00009 A3 MRI Y Y HEAD TREATMENT 120 WEEK 36 Row PRSTDTC PRSTDY 1 (cont) 2010 -01-01 -3 2 (cont) 2010 -01-01 -3 3 (cont) 2010 -01-01 -3 4 (cont) 2010 -05-27 144 5 (cont) 2010 -05-28 145 6 (cont) 2010 -05-28 145 7 (cont) 2010 -09-17 257 8 (cont) 2010 -09-17 257
