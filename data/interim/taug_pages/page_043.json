It details data entries for locations of recurrence identified via CT scans and how these occurrences are documented in the Tumor (TU), Tumor Results (TR), and Response (RS) domains, as well as the use of a Disease Recurrence Indicator variable to capture whether disease recurrence has been identified at specific visits.",
