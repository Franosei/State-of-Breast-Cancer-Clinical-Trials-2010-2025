The test Tumor State (TUMSTATE) could be used with the value of PRESENT (refer to SDTM Examples for Oncology Use Cases (available at: http://wiki.cdisc.org /x/5yuyAQ ) Example 12) . The RS domain holds the disease’s response to treatment. In this example, the test is a simple query: “Has disease recurrence been identified?” which is given as an indicator, like so: Row 1: Disease recurrence was not identified at Week 20. Row 2: Disease recurrence was identified at Week 36. rs.xpt Row STUDYID DOMAIN USUBJID RSSEQ RSGRPID RSLNKGRP RSTESTCD RSTEST RSCAT 1 PQR4444 RS PQR4444 -70000 1 A2 DRCRIND Disease Recurrence Indicator PROTOCOL DEFINED RESPONSE CRITERIA 2 PQR4444 RS PQR4444 -70000 2 A3 DRCRIND Disease Recurrence Indicator PROTOCOL DEFINED RESPONSE CRITERIA Row RSORRES RSSTRESC RSEVAL EPOCH VISITNUM VISIT RSDTC RSDY 1 (cont) N N INVESTIGATOR TREATMENT 80 WEEK 20 2010 -05-27 144 2 (cont) Y Y INVESTIGATOR TREATMENT 120 WEEK 36 2010 -09-17 257 Relationships between datasets are defined in RELREC.
