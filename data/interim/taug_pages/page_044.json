  "page_summary": "This page provides an example of a neoadjuvant breast cancer trial where the primary objective is to compare the rate of pathologic complete response (pCR) in the breast at the time of surgery after eight weeks of preoperative treatment. The example demonstrates documentation and data formats in CDISC standards for the representation and analysis of pCR. It also gives a brief description of the use of ADaM datasets in supporting endpoint analysis, but specifies the examples are illustrative rather than definitive standards.",
