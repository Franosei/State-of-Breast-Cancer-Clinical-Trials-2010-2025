In this example, the study treatment was given for eight weeks prior to surgery. This example has been adapted from SDTM Examples for Oncology Use Cases (available at: http://wiki.cdisc.org/x/5yuyAQ ), Example 15. Data not shown in this example include: • The CT s can (PR) that identified the tumor (TU) • The preliminary biopsy (PR) to confirm pathologicall y that the tumor was cancerous (MI) , and to plant a tracer chip for later surgery (DI, DO, DT (see SDTMIG- MD for guidance on handling data pertaining to medical devices) ) • Eight weeks of neoadjuvant treatme nt (EX/EC) • The breast resection and sentinel node biopsy at the end of Week 8 (PR) and associated pathologic examinations (MI) that confirmed pCR according to the protocol The pCR itself, as a response of the disease to treatment, is shown in the RS examp le below. rs.xpt Row STUDYID DOMAIN USUBJID RSSEQ RSTESTCD RSTEST RSCAT RSORRES RSSTRESC RSEVAL EPOCH VISITNUM 1 IHR0298 RS IHR0298 -11100 1 PATHRESP Pathologic Response WHO BREAST pCR pCR INVESTIGATOR TREATMENT 40 Row VISIT RSDTC RSDY 1 (cont) WEEK 8 20010-04-02 74 5 Analysis Data This section illustrates the use of the Analysis Data Model (ADaM) to create datasets to support the analysis of endpoints common to breast cancer trials. Adherence to the basic principles of ADaM ensures that the analysis datasets support traceability back to the source SDTM dat a. This traceability provides the consumer of the analysis dataset with the under standing of how derived data were developed and how the data can be used to generate the statistical results. This section is not intended to illustrate every possible variable that might be included in analysis datasets created for st atistical analysis of BrCa . Additionally, the examples are intended to be descriptive and illustrative of the use of the ADaM model , and should not be interpreted as the complete analysis requirements for BrCa trials. The metadata and derivations presented are for illustrative purposes only , and are not meant to imply a universally accepted definition or derivation of the variables. The examples should not be viewed as a statement of the standard themselves but rather an example of the application of the AD aM
