  "page_summary": "This page introduces analysis endpoints commonly used in breast cancer clinical trials, providing an overview of their classification into time-to-event and response endpoints. It details how these endpoints, especially time-to-event endpoints like progression-free survival (PFS), are defined, measured, and censored within clinical trials. The page also references relevant CDISC ADaM documentation and notes that full definitions and methodology for censoring and endpoint derivation are further discussed in subsequent sections.",
