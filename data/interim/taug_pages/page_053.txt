HER2STAT is equal to MI.MISTRESC when MI.MITEST represents HER2 Status. MI.MITEST is subject to spons or controlled terminology. ERSTAT Estrogen Receptor Status Char 1+; 2+; 3+; Positive ; Negative This is the ER assessment of the subject at randomization . ERSTAT is equal to MI.MISTRESC when MI.MITEST represents Estrogen Receptor Status. MI.MITEST is subject to sponsor -controlled terminology . VISCERAL Visceral Disease Char Y;N This is an indicator of whether v isceral disease is present . Visceral disease is normally captured in an SDTM domain.

These data elements , such as the dates and results of a radiologic image or other interventions, are described in the protocol and/or within the SAP. By creating a database of these data element s for each subject, the review and understanding of the derivation of time-to-event endpoints analysis is supported. For the purposes of this document and the datasets used below, this will be referred to as an event dataset. In constructing the event dataset, the different types of events that are evaluated for the time-to-event analysis should be documented as an event within the database. At a minimum , the critical events used to identify the duration for a time-to-event analysis should be included. However, for various reasons such as sensitivity analysis, the choice of dates used to calculate the time to an event can vary depending on the methodology. For example, an assessment of progression might be made by both an investigator and an adjudication committee. These independent assessments may result in the identification of different dates for the qualifying event. This yields a different calculation for the time-to-event analysis. This type of sensitivity analysis is not uncommon in trials where th e characterization of important events is not based on a single and universally agreed -upon assessment. This situation is illustrated below by the inclusion of all possible events for a subject that are made using multiple methodologies . Inclusion of all p ossible methods for determining an event allows for a comparison between these methodologies and an identification of which record was selected over another for the time-to-event analysis. Since traceability is built into the event dataset through the SRCD OM, SRCVAR, SRCSEQ variables, this also gives a reviewer the ability to review all events that were considered for the time- to-event analysis , identify the event that was selected, and consider the impact of the analysis of alternate selections . Creating the event dataset requires posting records for each event that occurs for each subject. The analysis flag can be used to identify those events that can be used in the time-to-event ( TTE) analysis dataset for time-to-event analysis. The basic structure of t he event dataset is as follows.
