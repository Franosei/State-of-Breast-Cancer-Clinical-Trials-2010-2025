All rights reserved May 16, 2016 Provisional 5.3.2.1 Use of a Provisional Variable Per the ADaM Implementation guide, the content of a parameter (PARAM) should be fully descriptive and not require any addition al qualifying variables to fully understand the content of AVAL. Requiring the value of PARAM to fully describe the content of AVAL ensures clarity and communication about the biomedical concept that is being expressed for the value of PARAM. However, there are situations in which the derivation of AVAL for a given para meter concept can vary, not according to the derivation algorithm, but by the methodology used for the calculation. For example, for sensitivity analyses of time-to- event parameters , AVAL may be calculated using different dates depending on choices made by the investigator versus an adjudicator. In this situation, there is no change in the parameter concept and the meaning of AVAL. The CDISC ADaM team is in the early stages of considering whether to allow a special purpose parameter -qualifying variable, PARQUAL. One advantage of using this qualifying variable would be that the same controlled terminology could be used for PARAM and PARAMCD. If ratified, the use of this variable would be limited and would only apply to situations where there is no change i n the interpretation of AVAL. The example below utilizes this special purpose variable , but readers should fully appreciate that this variable is provisional and is subject to change. ADEVENT Variable Metadata – One record per subject per evaluation Vari able Name Variable Label Type Codelist/ Controlled Terms Notes STUDYID Study Identifier Char ADSL .STUDYID USUBJID Unique Subject Identifier Char ADSL .USUBJID TRTP Planned Treatment Char Planned Treatment ASEQ Analysis Sequence Number Num Sequential number for associating a record number in the ADEVENT dataset. Unique number per subject per parameter per parameter qualifier per analysis start date. ASTDT Analysis Start Date Num This is the date that the event occurred. RS.RSDTC when PARAMCD = ‘ASSESS’ DS.DSSTDTC when PARAMCD = ‘DISPOSIT’ AE.AESTDTC or MH.MHSTDTC or DV.DVSTDTC or CM.CMSTDTC, or PR.PRSTDTC or some other source data for an event which prevents further assessments when PARAMCD = ‘EVENT’ where –DTC variables are converted to numeric date format. ASTDY Analysis Start Relative Day Num This is t he number of days from randomization to the date of the reported event. ASTDT – ADSL.RANDDT + 1 PARQUAL Parameter Qualifier Char INVESTIGATOR ; CENTRAL; PATHOLOGIC; PROTOCOL This identifies the source of the Parameter. Investigator for investigator -based assessments ; Central for central imaging assessments; Pathologic for an assessment by biopsy ; and Protocol for events affecting assessment. PARAM Parameter Char ASSESSMENT ; DISPOSITION ; EVENT These are the different categories of events that can occur during the execution of the study. ASSESSMENT: The RECIST assessments typically collected from the RS domain. DISPOSIT ION: These are dispositions collected during the study. Typically expected would be the date randomized, date treatment ended, and date withdrew from study. EVENT : These are events that occur during the conduct of a clinical trial. In some cases, they could be protocol violations or events that prevent further ass essments from being made . PARAMCD Parameter Code Char ASSESS ; DISPOSIT ; EVENT Assigned based on the data source. If RECIST assessment then PARAMCD = ‘ASSESS’ If disposition event then PARAMCD = ‘DISPOSIT’ Proposed
