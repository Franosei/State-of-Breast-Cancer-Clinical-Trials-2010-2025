  "page_summary": "This page provides guidance on the use of specific variables (such as CNSR, EVNTDESC, SRCDOM, SRCVAR, SRCSEQ) in the context of time-to-event endpoints in breast cancer studies, with examples involving endpoints like Duration of Response (DOR), Progression-Free Survival (PFS), and Overall Survival (OS). It describes censoring rules, event description conventions, and the use of the ADTTE dataset, referencing how these variables are populated depending on the data source and event capture method.",
