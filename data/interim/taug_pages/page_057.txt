Otherwise CNSR = 0 . EVNTDESC Event or Censori ng Description Char If an event is censored, then the reason for censoring should be described. In most cases this can be carried forward from the ADEVENT dataset. Although EVNTDESC is a permitted variable , it adds important details about censoring, so th is variable to the data set always should be taken into consideration. Some examples for defining EVENTDESC: PARAMCD = ‘PFS’: If CNSR = 0, then EVNTDESC = ‘DOCUMENTED PROGRESSION. ’ PARAMCD = ‘OS’: If CNSR = 0, then EVNTDESC = ‘DEATH .’ Otherwise , if CNSR = 1 , then EVNTDESC = ‘CENSORED AT TIME OF LAST ASSESSMENT .’ SRCDOM Source Data Char The SDTM domain or ADaM dataset name that relates to the analysis value. If all events are captured in ADEVENT, then SRCDOM = ‘ADEVENT .’ If ADTTE is created dir ectly from SDTM domains, then SRCDOM is equal to the domain where the data is captured. SRCVAR Source Variable Char The name of the column that relates to the analysis value. If all events are captured in ADEVENT, then SRCVAR will typically be ‘ASTDY .’ In some instances, such as PARAMCD = ‘DOR ,’ there may not be one specific variable that will contain the value , so SRCVAR will be null. If ADTTE is created directly from SDTM domains, then SRCVAR is equal to the column that corresponds to the SRCDOM where the data is captured. SRCSEQ Source Sequence Number Num The sequence number of the row that relates to the analysis value. If all events are captured in ADEVENT, then SRCSEQ will typically be set to ASEQ. In some instances, such as PARAMCD = ‘DOR ,’ there may not be one specific record that will contain the value , so SRCSEQ will be null. If ADTTE is created directly from SDTM domains, then SRCSEQ is equal to the --SEQ of the corresponding row in the SRCDOM where the data is captured. adtte.xpt Row STUDYI D USUBJID PARQUAL PARAMCD AVAL CNSR SRCSEQ 1 ABC -123 ABC -123-001 INVESTIGATOR PFS 87 0 11 2 ABC -123 ABC -123-001 CENTRAL PFS 88 0 12 3 ABC -123 ABC -123-002 INVESTIGATOR PFS 19 1 5 4 ABC -123 ABC -123-002 CENTRAL PFS 20 1 6 Given the approach of using an intermediate dataset, ADEVENT, for the collation of all information pertaining to events and censoring, additiona l child datasets beyond ADTTE can be created. Below is an example of an analysis dataset sourced from ADEVENT that contains paramet ers sp ecific to best overall response.
