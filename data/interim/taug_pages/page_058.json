  "page_summary": "This page provides information about variable definitions and coding conventions in CDISC datasets relevant to breast cancer studies, focusing specifically on variables used to represent the 'Best Overall Response' (BOR) parameter in analysis datasets. It details the possible qualifiers for assessment sources, the response ranking, and how analysis values are mapped from categorical clinical response terms. The page includes examples of variables such as PARAM, PARAMCD, AVAL, and AVALC as applied to BOR assessments.",
