Investigator for investigator based assessments ; Central for central imaging assessments ; Pathologic for an assessment by biopsy ; and Protocol for events affecting assessment. PARAM Parameter Char Best Overall Response These are the parameters used for efficacy analysis. PARAMCD Parameter Code Char BOR For best overall response , set to ‘BOR .’ AVAL Analysis Value Num For parameters that have categorical response, AVAL can be used to capture the numerical ranking of the results. For example: PARAMCD = ‘BOR’: If AVALC = ‘CR’ then AVAL = 1 If AVALC = ‘PR’ then AVAL = 2 If AVALC = ‘SD’ then AVAL = 3 If AVALC = ‘PD’ then AVAL = 4 AVALC Analysis Value (C) Char PARAMCD = ‘BOR’: ADEVENT.ANL01FL = ‘Y and ADVENT.PARAMCD = ‘ASSESS ,’ then set to the best response where ranking from best to worst is ‘CR ,’ ‘PR ,’ ‘SD ,’ ‘PD .’ SRCDOM Source Data Char * The SDTM domain or ADaM dataset name that relates to the analysis value. If all events are captured in ADEVENT, then SRCDOM = ‘ADEVENT .’ If ADTTE is created directly from SDTM domains, then SRCDOM is equal to the domain where the data is captured. SRCVAR Source Va riable Char * The name of the column that relates to the analysis value. If all events are captured in ADEVENT, then SRCVAR will be ‘AVALC’ If ADTTE is created directly from SDTM domains, then SRCVAR is equal to the column that corresponds to the SRCDOM where the data is captured. SRCSEQ Source Sequence Number Num The sequence number of the row that relates to the analysis value. If all events are captured in ADEVENT, then SRCSEQ will be set to ASEQ. If ADTTE is created directly from SDTOM domains, then SRCSEQ is equal to the --SEQ of the corresponding row in the SRCDOM where the data is captured. adresp.xpt Row STUDYID USUBJID PARQUAL PARAMCD AVAL AVALC SRCSEQ 1 ABC -123 ABC -123-001 INVESTIGATOR BOR 2 PR 7 2 ABC -123 ABC -123-001 CENTRAL BOR 2 PR 8 3 ABC -123 ABC -123-002 INVESTIGATOR BOR 3 SD 5 4 ABC -123 ABC -123-002 CENTRAL BOR 3 SD 6 Proposed Proposed
