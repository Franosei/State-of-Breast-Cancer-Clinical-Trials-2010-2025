CDISC Therapeutic Area Data Standards: User Guide for Breast Cancer (Version 1.0) Â© 2016 Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium, Inc. All rights reserved Page 59 Provisional May 16, 2016 Appendices Appendix A: Project Proposal CFAST is proposing development of v1.0 of the CDISC Breast Cancer (BC) Therapeutic -area Data Standard. This standard would build on the existing SDTM standards and related CDASH standards to facilitate the collection and use of data relevant to BC clinical trials. The workgroup proposes developing a CDISC therapeutic area User Guide, including concept maps, met adata, examples and controlled terminology. The standardization effort is expected to focus on the following areas of specific interest to BC: Data to substantiate diagnosis, including H&E, ER/PR/Her2 status, as well as other key biomarkers (e.g., Ki -67, luminal A, luminal B, Oncotype DX or other gene profile assays); Medical and relevant family history (oncologic, gynecologic, and general); RECIST 1.1 tumor lesion burden and response measurements; Bone lesion assessments; Imaging modality; Key time to ev ent analysis endpoints, including overall, progression, and disease- free survival ; Treatment history type (systemic, radiological, surgical) and intent (neo/adjuvant, curative, palliative); Post -study treatment therapies type (systemic, radiological, surgi cal) and intent (curative, palliative); Historical/preexisting and treatment emergent adverse events using CTCAE/MedDRA terms and severity criteria; Treatment and study disposition, including reasons for discontinuation of study treatment and study partici pation; Cardiac function assessment; Concomitant medications, Health care resource utilization (related to both disease and supportive care) including hospitalization, intensive care, emergency visits, and hospice care. The project is planned to begin in Q1 2014, with target completion of the BC data standard and User Guide in Q4, 2014. [dates tentative]
