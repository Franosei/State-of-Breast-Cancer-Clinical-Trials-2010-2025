Notes:
• No hard-coded category lists. Values are taken directly from your columns and lightly normalized (case/spacing only).
• Combined labels (e.g., "PHASE1; PHASE2") are preserved as combined categories (no manual roll-ups).
• To change grouping (e.g., roll Phase I/II together), do that upstream when creating the columns themselves.
