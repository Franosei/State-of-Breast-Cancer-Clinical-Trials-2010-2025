Endpoints analysis (eligible trials only; policy = PCD + 12 months):
- Eligible trials (should have reported): 4,732
- Eligible trials WITH results: 947

Per-endpoint (counts within eligible trials that PLANNED the endpoint):

- Non Target Response: planned=0, reported w/ endpoint=0 (0.0% of planned), reported but MISSING planned endpoint=0 (0.0% of planned)

Overall across endpoints (eligible & planned): planned=3,837, reported w/ endpoint=792 (20.6%), reported but MISSING planned endpoint=231 (6.0%)

Notes:
• Entire analysis is restricted to trials that have reached Primary Completion Date + 12 months.
• Endpoint presence is inferred from `detected_endpoint_names` by matching names to each endpoint label.
• If you maintain a canonical mapping from ENDPOINT_COLS → reported endpoint labels, add it to improve matching.
